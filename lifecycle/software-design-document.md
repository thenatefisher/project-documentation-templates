# Software Design Document

## Introduction

### Purpose
Use a software design document to ensure that the software optimizes the qualities which are most important to the customer. While the requirements ensure we build the right thing, this document ensures we build it the *right way*. In addition, this design document can be used to:
- improve schedule confidence (see cost of a defect over phases)
- reduce development detours (ie unnecessary experimentation and churn)
- transfer understanding of a software system to other developers
- enhance an SRD via detection of derived requirements

## Overview

## Design Patterns
Call out any specific design patterns used and their purpose. 

## Organizational Design 

### Modules
Description of all software domains in the design. These will be refenced later in models and design description.

### Data Management
Tabulated data structures, database models, etc.
Explain the major data entities involved in the system annd how they are stored. This is a good oportunity to analyze memory utilization or support the Resouce Utilization section.

### Class Diagrams for Entity Relationships

### Layers and Visibility

## Behavioral Design

### States and Transitions
Can take the form of statecharts or tabulated state, transition descriptions. 

## Functional Design 

### Sequence Diagrams for Entity Interactions
This information may be contained in use cases.

## Algorithms & Procedural Logic
Description of any algorithm procedural logic. For example, any DSP process such as calculation of a position estimate or filtering of data. 

## External Dependencies
If there are any non-original parts of the resulting executable image, they should be mentioned here. 

## Resource Utilization
Use this section as an opportunity to investigate processor memory and storage demands created by the design.
